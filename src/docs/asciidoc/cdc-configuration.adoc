= Configuring the Eventuate CDC Service

This section describes how to configure the Eventuate CDC service (Eventuate Local 0.30.X, Eventuate Tram 0.20.X).

== Introduction to the CDC service

The Eventuate CDC service is responsible reading the events/messages inserted into a https://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Transactional `OUTBOX` table] and publishing them to the message broker.
The following diagram shows the architecture.

image::./i/Eventuate_CDC.png[]

The key parts are as follows:

* Publisher service - the service that inserts a message/event into an OUTBOX table
* Consumer service - the service that consumes the message/event
* OUTBOX table - The EVENTS table for Eventuate Local application and the  MESSAGE table for en Eventuate Tram application
* Eventuate CDC service - the service that publishes messages/events to message broker
* Reader - a component of the CDC that retrieves inserted messages events using either transaction log tailing or polling using a `SELECT` statement
* Pipeline - invoked by the reader to publish the message
* Offset Store - used by the reader to record the current transaction log offset, e.g. MySQL binlog
* Publisher - used by the pipeline to publish the message/event to the message broker
* Zookeeper - used by the reader for leadership election when clustered

The Eventuate CDC service is a Spring Boot application.

=== Supported databases

Eventuate CDC supports the following databases:

* MySQL
* Postgres
* Microsoft SQL server

It can also support other databases that have a JDBC driver, although the CDC service would need to be rebuilt with the driver.

=== Supported message brokers

Eventuate CDC supports the following message brokers

* Apache Kafka - Eventuate Local and Eventuate Tram
* Apache ActiveMQ - Eventuate Tram only
* RabbitMQ - Eventuate Tram only
* Redis - Eventuate Tram only


=== Docker images

The Eventuate CDC service is conveniently packaged as a Docker image.
The latest version is

== How it works

To use the Eventuate CDC service, you configure one or more readers and pipelines and a publisher

* Reader - reads events/messages inserted into the database by either https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html[tailing the transaction log] or https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html[polling using queries]
* Pipeline - transforms the inserted message/event into a message to publish to a message broker destination (topic, queue, exchange etc)
* Publisher - invoked by the pipeline to publish the message to the message broker

=== About Readers

A reader retrieves each message/event inserted into the database and invokes the pipeline that’s interested in that message/event.

==== Strategies for reading messages/events

A CDC reader reads messages/events using one of the following mechanisms:

* MySQL - transaction log tailing using the MySql binlog protocol
* Postgres - transaction log tailing using Postgres WAL
* Generic JDBC - polling the `OUTBOX` table by periodically executing a SQL `SELECT` statement to retrieve messages and an `UPDATE` statement to mark them as having been read.

==== MySQL binlog current offset storage

The MySQ binlog reader records its current position (file, offset) in the MySql binlog in an offset store.
There are two types of offset store depending on which message broker is being used:

* Apache Kafka topic - when using Apache Kafka
* Database table -  when a message broker other than Apache Kafka

The offset is stored using a key value of `reader.offsetStoreKey` property (or name of the reader is used if property is not specified explicitly), which enables multiple readers to use the same store.

==== CDC Leadership election

When running a cluster of Eventuate CDC services, a reader uses a Zookeeper-based leadership election to determine which reader is active.
When cdc is configured to use Redis message broker (`spring.profiles.active=Redis`), Redis is used instead of Zookeeper for leadership.

=== About Pipelines

A pipeline, which is invoked by a reader, transforms the inserted message/event into a message to publish to a message broker destination (topic, queue, exchange etc).
There are two types of pipelines:

* Eventuate Local
** Processes events inserted into an EVENTS table
** An event’s aggregate type determines which message broker channel the event is published to
* Eventuate
** Processes messages inserted into an MESSAGE table
** The row’s DESTINATION column specifies the message broker channel the message is published to

=== About Publishers

A publisher is invoked by the pipeline and publishes the message/event to a message broker destination.
There are three types of publishers:

* Apache Kafka
* Apache ActiveMQ
* RabbitMQ
* Redis

== Configuring the Eventuate CDC service

The Eventuate CDC is configured using https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-external-config[Spring Boot-style properties].
You can, for example, configure an Eventuate CDC service that is deployed as a container by setting the container's environment variables.

There are two styles of configuration:

* Single pipeline - this is intended for simple scenarios and to simplify upgrading from previous versions
* Multi pipeline - allows the configuration of multiple pipelines, such as when each service has its OUTBOX table, or when an application uses both Eventuate Local and Eventuate Tram

=== Single pipeline configuration

This style of configuration is almost identical to how previous versions of the CDC were configured.
It creates a single reader and pipeline.

Reader:

* The default reader type is MySQL binlog
* Enable Postgres WAL by `spring.profile.active=PostgresWal`
* Enable polling by `spring.profile.active=EventuatePolling`

Pipeline:

* The pipeline type is determined by `eventuate.cdc.type` property
   * `eventuate.cdc.type=EventuateLocal` - Eventuate Local pipeline
   * `eventuate.cdc.type=EventuateTram` - Eventuate Tram pipeline (used by default when property is not specified)

Publishing:

* Eventuate Local CDC service - Apache Kafka only
* Eventuate Tram CDC service - The default is Apache Kafka but you can use Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Redis by activating the appropriate profile (described below).

There are two sets of properties, one for the reader and another for the pipeline.

==== Configuring a pipeline

A pipeline is configured using Spring framework properties that obey the following naming convention: `eventuate.cdc.pipeline.<pipeline name>.<property name>`.
For example, you can configure a pipeline called `PIPELINE1` using environment variables such as these:

----
EVENTUATE_CDC_PIPELINE_PIPELINE1_TYPE: eventuate-local

=== Configuring the publisher

The publisher is invoked by the pipeline to publish a message/event to the message broker.
The Eventuate Local CDC service only supports Apache Kafka, since it relies on Kafka’s message retention capability.
By default, the Eventuate Tram CDC service publishes messages to Apache Kafka.
But it also supports Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, and Redis.

== Configuring infrastructure services

The CDC service requires various infrastructure services including:

* Relational database, such as MySQL or Postgres
* Message broker, such as Apache Kafka

=== CDC Database schema

The Eventuate CDC service requires several tables.
The Eventuate MySQL and Postgres images define these tables.

==== `CDC_MONITORING` table

The CDC service uses the `CDC_MONITORING` table to implement a 'heart beat' mechanism.
Each reader that uses transaction log tailing (MySQL binlog/Postgres WAL) periodically updates a row in this table and measures the delay in receiving the update from the transaction log.


==== `OFFSET_STORE` table

When publishing messages to Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, Redis, the MySql binlog reader records the current binlog position in this table.

=== Apache Kafka broker configuration

The MySQL binlog reader records the current binlog position in the `offsetStorageTopicName` topic.
This topic should have the following configuration:

* Compacted topic with a relatively short retention time
* Replication factor of 3

== CDC service observability

The Eventuate CDC service has several features that enable monitoring in a production environment.

=== Health Check endpoint

The Eventuate CDC service has a standard https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/health-check-api.html[Spring Boot health check endpoint] `<eventuate-local-base-url>/actuator/health`.
It reports on the health of the following:

* Apache Zookeeper - verifies that the CDC service can connect to Apache Zookeeper
* Apache Kafka - verifies that the CDC service can connect to Apache Kafka
* CDC readers - the health of a reader is determined as follows:
** A reader is always healthy when it is not leader
** A reader that is the leader is unhealthy when one of the following is true:
*** It is not connected to the database (PostgresWal, MySqlBinlog only)
*** It did not receive events recently as defined by the `eventuatelocal.cdc.max.event.interval.to.assume.reader.healthy` property, which defaults to 60 seconds. (PostgresWal, MySqlBinlog only)
* Publisher - is unhealthy when the last attempt at publishing the message failed.

=== Metrics

The Eventuate CDC service publishes the https://microservices.io/patterns/observability/application-metrics.html[standard Spring Boot/Prometheus metrics] via the following endpoint `<eventuate-local-base-url>/actuator/prometheus`.

[cols=3, options="header"]
|===

| Name

==  Upgrading to the Eventuate CDC from older versions of the CDC (pre-Eventuate Local 0.30.X, pre-Eventuate Tram 0.20.X)

The configuration properties of the Eventuate CDC are different than older versions of the CDC.
When upgrading, you need to specify configuration properties that correctly correspond to those of the older CDC.
In particular, if you are using MySQL you need to ensure that the Eventuate CDC is correctly configured to read the binlog offset maintained by the older CDC.

The upgrade process consists of the following steps:

. Stop old CDC
. Apply schema migration to add new tables
. Configure the new Eventuate CDC
. Start the new Eventuate CDC

=== Migrating the schema

You will need to update the database schema with a script similar to:

----
CREATE TABLE cdc_monitoring (reader_id VARCHAR(1000) PRIMARY KEY, last_time BIGINT);
CREATE TABLE offset_store(client_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, serialized_offset VARCHAR(255));

ALTER TABLE message ADD creation_time BIGINT;
ALTER TABLE received_messages ADD creation_time BIGINT;
----

This script creates two new tables and adds the `creation_time` column to the messaging tables.

=== Configuring the Eventuate CDC

There are few different upgrade scenarios depending on your starting point:

* Old (Debezium-based) CDC - `eventuateio/eventuateio-local-cdc-service:0.22.1.RELEASE` or older
* 'New' Eventuate Local CDC - `eventuateio/eventuateio-local-new-cdc-service:0.22.1.RELEASE` or older
* Eventuate Tram CDC - `eventuateio/eventuate-tram-cdc-mysql-service:0.11.1.RELEASE` or older
* Multiple older Eventuate Local/Eventuate Tram CDCs

.Verifying the Eventuate CDC configuration using the dry run configuration parameter
****
To verify that you have correctly configured the Eventuate CDC, you can specify this property `eventuate.cdc.service.dry.run=true`, e.g. set the environment variable `EVENTUATE_CDC_SERVICE_DRY_RUN=true`.
When this property is set to true, the Eventuate CDC will display the starting offset of each reader and then exit.
Once you have verified that the Eventuate CDC will resume at the right place, you can either remove this property or change its value to `true`.

TODO add example

****


==== Upgrading from old (Debezium-based) Eventuate Local CDC

In order to upgrade from the Debezium-based Eventuate Local CDC for MySQL (`eventuateio/eventuateio-local-cdc-service:0.22.1.RELEASE` or older) please define these additional properties:

[cols=2, options="header"]
|===

| Name
| Value

| EVENTUATELOCAL_CDC_READ_OLD_DEBEZIUM_DB_OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC
| true

| EVENTUATELOCAL_CDC_MYSQL_BINLOG_CLIENT_UNIQUE_ID
| 85744 (the value used by the Debezium-based Eventuate Local CDC)

| EVENTUATELOCAL_CDC_OFFSET_STORE_KEY
| MySqlBinlog

|===


The `EVENTUATELOCAL_CDC_READ_OLD_DEBEZIUM_DB_OFFSET_STORAGE_TOPIC` property configures the Eventuate CDC to Debezium-maintained offset from the old offset store Apache Kafka topic.

==== Upgrading from 'new' Eventuate Local CDC

When upgrading from the 'new' Eventuate Local CDC (`eventuateio/eventuateio-local-new-cdc-service:0.22.1.RELEASE` or older), you need to make a few changes.

// Example: https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application/pull/23

Some properties have changed names and default values.

| EVENTUATELOCAL_CDC_MYSQL_BINLOG_CLIENT_UNIQUE_ID
| 1 (or whatever was specified previously)

|===

==== From Eventuate Tram CDC

To upgrade from the Eventuate Tram CDC ()`eventuateio/eventuate-tram-cdc-mysql-service:0.11.1.RELEASE` or older), you must define these properties.

[cols=2, options="header"]
|===

|===

==== Upgrading an application that has multiple CDC services to a single CDC service

You can replace multiple CDC services, such as one for Eventuate Local and another for Eventuate Tram, with a single CDC service configured with multiple readers and pipelines.
For example, the https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application/[FTGO application] uses a single CDC service with Eventuate Local and Eventuate Tram pipelines.
