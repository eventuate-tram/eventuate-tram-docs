== About Eventuate Tram

Eventuate Tram is a platform for link:./distributed-data-management.html[managing distributed data] in a microservice architecture.
It enables a services to send and receive messages as part of an database transaction.
It does this by implementing the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Transactional outbox pattern].
This pattern is foundation of maintaining data consistency within a microservice architecture.
It is used to implement the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[Saga pattern], which implements transactions multiple services, and the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html[CQRS pattern], which implements queries that retrieve data from multiple services.

Eventuate Tram provides several messaging abstractions:

* messaging - send and receive messages over named channels
* events - publish and consume domain events
* commands - asynchronously invoke a service by sending a command message and receiving a reply message

=== The architecture of an Eventuate Tram application

The following diagram shows the architecture of the https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-examples-customers-and-orders[Eventuate Tram Customers and Orders application]:

image::https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-examples-customers-and-orders/raw/master/images/Eventuate_Tram_Customer_and_Order_Architecture.png[]

The application consists of three services:

* `Customer Service` - implements a REST API for managing customers.
The service persists the `Customer` JPA entity in a MySQL/Postgres database.
Using `Eventuate Tram`, it publishes `Customer` domain events that are consumed by the `Order Service` and the `Order History Service`.

* `Order Service` - implements REST API for managing orders.
The service persists the `Order` JPA entity in MySQL/Postgres database.
Using `Eventuate Tram`, it publishes `Order` domain events that are consumed by the `Customer Service` and the `Order History Service`.
The `Order Service` creates orders using a choreography-based saga that consists of events being exchanged between the `Order Service` and `Customer Service`.

* `Order History Service` - implements REST API for querying a customer's order history.
This service subscribes to events published by the `Order Service` and `Customer Service` and updates a MongoDB-based CQRS view containing the order history.

The Eventuate Tram CDC service reads messages inserted into the `MESSAGE` table using either https://microservices.io/patterns/data/transaction-log-tailing.html[Transaction log tailing] or https://microservices.io/patterns/data/polling-publisher.html[Polling] and publishes them to a message broker, such as Apache Kafka.

=== About Eventuate Tram Sagas

https://github.com/eventuate-tram/eventuate-tram-sagas[Eventuate Tram sagas] builds on Eventuate Tram to provide https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[orchestration-based sagas].
Instead of simply relying on services to respond to domain events, you define a saga orchestrator, which tells the saga participants what operations to execute.
To understand the difference between choreography using domain events and orchestration, please read this https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[article] and see this https://www.slideshare.net/chris.e.richardson/yow2018-events-and-commands-developing-asynchronous-microservices[presentation].
