== Managing distributed data in a microservice architecture

A key characteristic of the microservice architecture is that https://microservices.io/patterns/data/database-per-service.html[each service has its own database].
This is important to ensure loose coupling but it makes transaction management and querying challenging.

### Maintaining data consistency is a challenge

You must implement business transactions that span services but two-phase commit (2PC) is rarely an option.

### Querying is a challenge

You must implement queries that retrieve data from multiple services.

## Using an asynchronous, microservice architecture.

The solution to these distributed data management problems is to use the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[Saga pattern] and the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html[CQRS pattern].
In such an architecture, services communicate asynchronously using domain events, and command/reply messages.


#### Using sagas to maintain data consistency

Sagas are a transaction model for the microservice architecture.
A saga is a sequence of local transactions.
Each local transaction updates the data in one service and sends a message/event that triggers the next transaction.
For more information, please read the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html[Saga pattern].

#### Using CQRS views

CQRS views are a way to implement queries that span services in a microservice architecture.
A CQRS view is a replica of data from one or more services that is optimized for a particular set of queries.
The service that maintains the view does so by subscribing to domain events.
Whenever a service, updates its data it publishes a domain event.
For more information, please read the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/cqrs.html[CQRS pattern].

### The problem of atomically updating the database and publishing messages

You can use an asynchronous architecture to solve the distributed data management challenges in a microservices architecture.
However, one major challenge with implementing an asynchronous architecture is atomically updating the database and sending a message.

Consider, for example, the `Create Order` use case.
The  service that implements this use case must perform two operations: insert a row into the ORDER table and publish an `OrderCreated` event.
It is essential that both operations are done atomically.
If only one operation happened because of a failure then the system would behave incorrectly.

The standard way to atomically update state and publish a message is to use a distributed transaction involving a database and a message broker.
However, for the reasons described earlier this is exactly what we do not want to do.
Instead, an application must use the https://microservices.io/patterns/data/application-events.html[Transactional outbox pattern].
The link:./about-eventuate-tram.html[Eventuate Tram framework] provides an implementation of this pattern.
